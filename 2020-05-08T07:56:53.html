        <h2>Scheme v. Python</h2>
<p>(I promised myself to stick to zettlekasten kind of note (small and
atomic), but here is a topic I have been thinking about for a while
and I think I have enough matter to make a full post.)</p>
<p>I have been practicing Scheme for 5 years and Python for more than 10
years.  I know other programming languages but Python and Scheme are
the two I am the most familiar with and the more invested in.</p>
<p>In this note, I will try to compare Scheme versus Python from high
level point of view of their respective ecosystems to a low level
point of view of nitty gritty good old lines of code.</p>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>Scheme grew in academical circles and until recently it was the
primary teaching material for computer science programming. The touted
book is known as
<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html">SICP</a>.
I have that book, I read it from time to time, but never completed any
exercices.  There is somewhat a cult around that book until the point
where it became a
<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/forums/meme-research/topics/47038-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-hugeass-image-dump-for-evidence">meme</a>. And
the book was adapted to JavaScript.</p>
<p>MIT university switched from Scheme to Python around 2009. The
rationale can be <em>grossly</em> summarized as nowadays coders do not need
to know all the stuff SICP teach, or try to teach.</p>
<p>This happened a little before or at the same time Machine Learning
frenzy happened, at which point data science was a thing.</p>
<p>Even if Scheme was teached decades in various universities, it has
little or not industrial footprint.  That is, there is not a lot of
users of Scheme.</p>
<p>This partly due to AI winter around 1980, that match with LISP winter
where LISP programming language like Scheme, even if very powerful and
high level, were slow.</p>
<h3>Standards and Implementations</h3>
<p>There is at least seven iterations over the definitions of Scheme
programming language. The latest is <a href="https://small.r7rs.org/">R7RS</a>.
There is (too many) implementations, among the most notable there is
Racket.  There is no reference implementation, but chibi scheme has
lot of traction toward that. Until recently the standard was put
together by a group of experts with a unanimity vote. Nowadays the
process is open to anyone.</p>
<p>Python is at verion 3.8. It used to be supervised by a BDFL, but
nowadays it is created by a group of core developers.  The reference
implementation is CPython, a bytecode interpreter, the other popular
implementations includes PyPy a Just-In-Time Compiler Virtual Machine.
There is also micropython that targets small hardware.</p>
<p>The main differences between both programming languages are as follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>A democractic standard versus core developer group</li>
<li>A lot of implementations versus a few implementations</li>
</ul>
<p>On microbenchmarks, Racket is faster than PyPy and CPython. And Racket
is not the fastest Scheme.</p>
<p>One might say, speed does not matter (except when it does).</p>
<p>Scheme open-source offering is fragmented, there is many
implementations, each of which used to have different module system,
which leads to maybe a lot of Scheme libraries, but since libraries
were incompatible between Scheme implementation, you would end missing
a few <em>things</em>.</p>
<p>Python open-source offering is more comparable to JavaScript.  That is
there is a lot of libraries available in the wild, and since most users
use CPython, there is no problem of compatibility.</p>
<h3>Language features</h3>
<p>Both Python and Scheme are LISP 1, that is they use the same
environment (or namespace) for variables and functions (that are called
procedures in Scheme).  I never practiced LISP 2 like Common Lisp or
elisp, so I can not really tell whether one is better than the other.</p>
<p>Scheme is lexically scoped, whereas Python is function-scoped. You do
not see the difference until you use Python's <code>nonlocal</code> or <code>global</code>.
The difference is minimal, the only thing that is surprising about
Python's <code>nonlocal</code> is the fact that it is an exception rule. That is,
the behavior is to bind a new variable possibly shadowing the
previously defined variable with the same name, exept when you do not
want to shadow.  Usually, in programming it is easier to think in
terms of "what you want" instead of "what you do not want" because the
general semantic of the negation is unbound (unlike boolean <code>not</code>).</p>
<p>Python has loads of features, and most structural change to the
language require a change in the implementation. Nowadays, the most
visible instance of that problem is the <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> keywords.</p>
<p>In general, the approach taken by Scheme is to have powerful enough
primitives to make it possible to adapt to most, if not any,
situations.  To compare to Python <code>async</code> and <code>await</code>, the approach
taken with Scheme to solve the same problem to have sequential
asynchronous code, does not require a change in the compiler or
virtual machine implementation.  Instead, Scheme implementation
provide a procedure that allows to customize the control flow. They
optimized for the general (or generic) case.  I took as example
sequential asynchronous code, but that is the same for class and
meta-class based code. All those, with Scheme can be defined as
libraries.</p>
