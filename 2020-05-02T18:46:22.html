        <h2>Hello World!</h2>
<p>I wanted to restart blogging but I figured that the regular blog
format does not work very well for me. So, instead I will try to keep
notes based on zettelkasten metodology available online.  I wrote a
nano zettlekasten based blog engine of sort that you can find on
<a href="https://github.com/amirouche/zettlekasten">github</a>.</p>
<h3>Kesako Zettelkasten?!</h3>
<blockquote><p>The Zettelkasten principles</p>
<p>A Zettelkasten is a phenomenal tool for storing and organizing your
knowledge, extending your&gt; memory, generating new connections
between ideas, and increasing your writing output. However, to make
the most of a Zettelkasten, you should follow some key principles.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The principle of atomicity: The term was coined by Christian
Tietze. It means that each note should contain one idea and one
idea only. This makes it possible to link ideas with a lase
focus.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The principle of autonomy: Each note should be autonomous,
meaning it should be self-contained and comprehensible on its
own. This allows notes to be moved, processed, separated, and
concatenated independently of its neighbors. It also ensures that
notes remain useful even if the original source of information
disappears.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Always link your notes: Whenever you add a note, make sure to
link it to already existing notes. Avoid notes that are
disconnected from other notes. As Luhmann himself put it, “each
note is just an element that derives its quality from the network
of links in the system. A note that is not connected to the
network will be lost, will be forgotten by the Zettelkasten”
(original in German).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Explain why you’re linking notes: Whenever you are connecting two
notes by a link, make sure to briefly explain why you are linking
them. Otherwise, years down the road when you revisit your notes,
you may have no idea why you connected them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use your own words: Don’t copy and paste. If you come across an
interesting idea and want to add it to your Zettelkasten, you
must express that idea with your own words, in a way that you’ll
be sure to understand years later. Don’t turn your Zettelkasten
into a dump of copy-and-pasted information.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Keep references: Always add references to your notes so that you
know where you got an idea from. This prevents plagiarism and
makes it easy for you to revisit the original source later on.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add your own thoughts to the Zettelkasten: If you have thoughts
of your own, add them to the Zettelkasten as notes while keeping
in mind the principle of atomicity, autonomy, and the need for
linking.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t worry about structure: Don’t worry about putting notes in
neat folders or into unique preconceived categories. As Schmidt
put it, in a Zettelkasten “there are no privileged positions” and
“there is no top and no bottom.” The organization develops
organically.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add connection notes: As you begin to see connections among
seemingly random notes, create connection notes, that is,
specific notes whose purpose is to link together other notes and
explain their relationship.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add outline notes: As ideas begin to coalesce into themes,
create outline notes. An outline note is a note that simply
contains a sequence of links to other notes, putting those other
notes into a particular order to create a story, narrative, or
argument.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Never delete: Don’t delete old notes. Instead, link to new notes
that explain what’s wrong with the old ones. In that way, your
Zettelkasten will reflect how your thinking has evolved over
time, which will prevent hindsight bias. Moreover, if you don’t
delete, you might revisit old ideas that may turn out to be
correct after all.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add notes without fear: You can never have too much information
in your Zettelkasten. At worst, you’ll add notes that won’t be
of immediate use. But adding more notes will never break your
Zettelkasten or interfere with its proper operation. Remember,
Luhmann had 90,000 notes in his Zettelkasten!</p>
</li>
